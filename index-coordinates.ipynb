    "# Preface - Tutorial Series on astropy.coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of tutorials on how to use the `astropy.coordinates` package to work with astronomical coordinates.\n",
    "We will introduce many of the key concepts underlying how to represent and transform astronomical coordinates using `astropy.coordinates`, including how to work with both position and velocity data within the coordinate objects. We will also explore how the `astropy.coordinates` package can be used to cross-match two catalogs that contain overlapping sources that may have been observed at different times.\n"
